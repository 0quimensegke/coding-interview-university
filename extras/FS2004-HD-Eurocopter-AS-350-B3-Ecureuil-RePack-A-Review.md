## The 3D Model and Virtual Cockpit
 
The 3D model of the AS 350 B3 is one of the highlights of this RePack. It is very detailed and realistic, with dynamic shine and reflections that change according to the lighting conditions. You can see every rivet, screw, and panel on the fuselage, as well as the rotor blades, skids, and antennas. The model also has opening doors, windows, and engine cowling, which you can control from the virtual cockpit or by using keyboard commands.
 
The virtual cockpit is equally impressive, with custom gauges and animations that simulate the real instruments and controls of the AS 350 B3. You can interact with almost every switch, knob, lever, and button in the cockpit, either with your mouse or with keyboard commands. The gauges are clear and easy to read, and they respond accurately to your inputs and the flight conditions. The virtual cockpit also has a working GPS unit, a radio stack, a transponder, and a autopilot panel.
 
## The Flight Model and Sound Set
 
The flight model of the AS 350 B3 is another strong point of this RePack. It is based on the real performance and handling data of the helicopter, and it feels very realistic and responsive. You can feel the effects of torque, wind, and inertia on the helicopter, as well as the changes in power and lift as you adjust the collective and cyclic. The flight model also simulates the FADEC system, which automatically controls the engine speed and fuel flow to optimize performance and safety.
 
The sound set of the AS 350 B3 is also very realistic and immersive. It was recorded from a real AS 350 B3 helicopter, and it captures every nuance of the engine noise, rotor sound, and cockpit ambiance. You can hear the subtle changes in pitch and volume as you increase or decrease the collective, as well as the distinctive whine of the Turbomeca Arriel 2B1 engine. The sound set also includes custom warning sounds, such as low rotor RPM, low fuel, overspeed, and fire.
