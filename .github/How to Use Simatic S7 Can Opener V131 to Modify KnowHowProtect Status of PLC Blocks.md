## Step 2: Open Your S7 Project or Library
 
Before running Simatic S7 Can Opener V1.31, make sure you close all applications that may interfere with your S7 project files, such as S7 Manager, S7 Editor, Protool, etc. Also, make a backup copy of your S7 project or library before using the tool, just in case something goes wrong.
 
Run CanOpener.exe and from Open menu select the desired S7 project or library. You will see a list of all blocks folders in your S7 project or library. If you have more than one S7 program in your project, you will see a list of all blocks folders for each program. You can filter different block families (FBs, FCs, OBs, DBs) by clicking on the tabs at the bottom.
 
## Step 3: Select and Modify Your Blocks
 
Select the blocks folder of your choice, then you will see a list of all blocks contained in that folder along with their protection status. You can select multiple blocks by holding Ctrl or Shift keys while clicking on them.
 
Use Protect or Unprotect buttons to set or remove protection from your selected blocks. You will be asked for a password at the first protect/unprotect request each time you run the program. The password is "CanOpener".
 
You can also use Toggle button to switch the protection status of your selected blocks from on to off or vice versa.
 
## Step 4: Save Your Changes
 
After modifying your blocks, you can save your changes by clicking on Save button. You can also use Save As button to save your modified blocks to a different location or with a different name.
 
You can now open your S7 project or library with S7 Manager or S7 Editor and access, edit or backup your source code as you wish.
